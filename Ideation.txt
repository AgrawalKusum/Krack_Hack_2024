ps: 4th-sustainable transportation
proposed solution: an application which helps the driver(user) to do predictive driving and servicing and fuel saving reminders to improve fuel efficiency and reduced fuel consumption.
unique features: 
1. provides suggestions on optimum speed for the vehicle based on vehicle model and the road conditions and traffic ahead.
2. provides reminders for reduction in fuel consumption like suggesting turning off engine when the car has been stationary for a while.
3. provides best route to avoid traffic in rush hour, hence reducing fuel consumption.
4. gives servicing reminders based on car model and car usage data.

Tech stack: Python
            Kivy
            MySQL
            Git
Future Scope: The app not only will contribute in tackling environment challenges by reducing pollution emission and fuel consumption of vehicles, it will also cut expenditure on fuel by optimizing vehicle usage.
Moreover, the best route feature helps save time while driving. 
As more people switch to e-vehicles in future, the app will continue to be useful by modifications to adapting electricity as fuel.
